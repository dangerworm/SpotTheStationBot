# SpotTheStationBot
This will be my first Twitter bot once I get it up and running.

# Method
First step was to scrape all the countries, regions and cities from the SpotTheStation web site (siteDataCollector).

Once I had those I read them into code to form a basic data structure in memory. Using some stop words and a bit of
logic I then attempted to figure out which city the user was interested in, then did some more scraping of the STS
site to get the latest times and positions.

Very dirty, but I just fancied having a go.
